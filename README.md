# Algorithms

This repository contains multiple projects of algorithm 
implementation in Java.

Most algorithms were taken my implementation of homework 
assignments from Stanford online course "Algorithms: 
Design and Analysis" offered at [coursera](coursera.org).

This repository is shared for reference and study of algorithms
only. Notice that it is against the honor code to copy 
other people's source code.
